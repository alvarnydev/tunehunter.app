MVP: only german results

modal functionality
maybe change index things to new load in trackpreview
- 5 tracks on iTunesdata -> also use for preview
- 1 track each on beatport, amazon, bandcamp based on the current itunes data -> requery on index change, for itunes change index

TODO:
1. Create Test Suite (Jest, Cypress)
2. Create Settings
3. Meaningful Results:
   - when store doesn't have it: NaN to something more meaningful (e.g. "not available")
   - cant find song to your input -> no store has it
4. Make responsive
5, API Integration
6. Modal to narrow down user input

FIX:
- profile rendering twice on first load
- bring searchbar into its correct width (right side overflows)

WATCH:
- token expiring after 60min of inactivity still happening?

OPTIMIZE: 
- tailwind purge
- react lazy
- use daisy's toasts? 
- daisyui
- spotify album image is 640x640 -> lots of data
- react icons size





EVENTUALLY:
add region menu (maybe min quality: aac 256, mp3 320, lossless)
Save calls in DB

MAYBE:
- Rate limiting search
- Retrowave fonts
- artist and title suggestions
- Put data fetching in ResultsTable and make it a RSC (child in pages.tsx rather than directly in TrackFinderForm) rather than use API
