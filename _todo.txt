_________________







- add lang to trackfinder form to properly route requests
- api key
- Validate input: react hook forms
- Convert results to table(s): array.map
- rate limiting search


2. Work
  - Provider context for SeachBar status
  - Add region + quality menu
      - aac 256, mp3 320, lossless
  - Add server actions, api for data requests
  - For mobile:
      - on button click hide menu

3. Jest, Cypress

Maybe:
- Retrowave fonts
- Animations
- Background more interesting


Fix:
- State in input component leading to unnecessary renders
- Lots of state sharing between toggler and input
- Put data fetching in ResultsTable and make it a RSC (child in pages.tsx rather than directly in TrackFinderForm) rather than use API
