MVP: only german results

create settings
make responsive

checkout rerendering behavior when manually triggering refresh of spotify data

results:
- when store doesn't have it: NaN to something more meaningful (e.g. "not available")
- cant find song to your input -> no store has it

fix
- profile rendering twice on first load
- bring searchbar into its correct width (right side overflows)
- token expiring after 60min of inactivity

particles

2. Modal to narrow down user input: <This one>, check out these other songs we found for your input
3. beatport, amazon, bandcamp data

optimizations: 
- tailwind purge
- react lazy
- use daisy's toasts? 
- daisyui


THEN:

add region menu (maybe min quality: aac 256, mp3 320, lossless)

test: jest, cypress

MAYBE:

- Rate limiting search
- Retrowave fonts
- Animations
- Background more interesting
- artist and title suggestions


Fix:
- Put data fetching in ResultsTable and make it a RSC (child in pages.tsx rather than directly in TrackFinderForm) rather than use API
